# Friday Midterm Check In

 - Please fork this repo to check in for the Friday midterm. This is to help us know who is here, since some students requested to attend a section for which they are not enrolled.
 - Just click the "Fork" button; you don't have to clone or anything.
    - If you haven't clicked the button by 8:31am, you'll likely have to come up front and give me your GitHub username individually.
 - In a moment, navigate back to https://github.com/dsgn425-2017 and refresh.
 - You'll see a banner across the top of that page with an invitation from me to join a team. Accept it.
 - Two new repositories will appear in the list. These two are the midterm.
 - The first one, Geometer, contains the general instructions for the midterm. Read all of the instructions carefully before you begin.
 - Take less than half of the 90 minutes for Geometer before you move on to part 2, Catalog Debug.
 - The exam ends at 10:05am and class begins again at 10:20am.
